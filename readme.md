# Sassy Starter

A Sass boilerplate organized with [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and topped with useful scaffold styles and variables.


## Get Started

This boilerplate requires mixins and extends from **Bourbon**, and **Neat**.

Install Neat and Bourbon into the stylesheet directory and start Sassing.
- **Bourbon** - [bourbon.io](http://bourbon.io/)
- **Neat** - [neat.bourbon.io](http://neat.bourbon.io/)

## Mobile First / Desktop First

By default, Sassy starter comes with Mobile First breakpoints and styles at `/layouts/_grid.scss` & `/utility/_grid-settings.scss`.

Desktop First styles are available in the `desktop-first` folder. Just replace these files in the project.
